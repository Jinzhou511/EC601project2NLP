# EC601project2NLP
1. This is EC601 project2: Google NLP
2. In this project, I chose a google NLP model and input the csv data into the model
3. The uploading and training took a very long time, about several hours
4. After training, we can input any word or sentence into test window, and this would tell us the emotion feature of the word
5. The emotion feature includes: ①enjoy ②achievement ③leisure ④affection ⑤exercise ⑥nature ⑦bonding
6. I uploaded the generated Python file and a PDF which includes parts of the test
